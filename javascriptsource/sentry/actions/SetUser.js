 * @param {string} _id - Your internal identifier for the user.
 * @param {string} username - The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.
 * @param {string} email - An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.
 * @param {string} ip_address - The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user. Sentry will attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data, if available.
 * @returns {Promise.<void>}
